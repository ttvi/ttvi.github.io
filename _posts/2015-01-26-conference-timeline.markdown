<p>This post describes a conceptual idea of a conference watcher that enables users to manage their target conferences.</p>
 <p>I would appreciate anyone who could help me to change this image into an interative webpage with the following features:
	<ul>
	  <li>Add/Remove a conference</li>
	  <li>When a conference is selected, those overlapped will be unavailable (grayed out); this is for detecting double submissions</li>
	  <li>Manage by publication: each publication has its own timeline</li>
	</ul>
 </p>
