 <h2>Conference Timeline</h2>
 <p>Appreciation to anyone that can help me to change this image into an interative webpage with the following features:
	<ul>
	  <li>Add/Remove a conference</li>
	  <li>When a conference is selected, the others will be unavailable (grayed out); this is for detecting double submissions</li>
	  <li>Manage by publications: different publications have different timeline</li>
	</ul>
